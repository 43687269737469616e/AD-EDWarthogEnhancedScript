## User Preferences (AD_EDUserPrefs_v.4.x.x.tmh) ##

Although it is not practical to have everything as a user preference, for key features & play styles I have tried to cover as many as possible in a simple to use User Preference section with the goal to make the script accessible to as many players as possible. This will help those who do not know the scripting programming language make quick changes to suite their needs.

In the following sections below, I will explain what each setting does & what options there are to configure plus cover off a few other setting you may wish to change to integrate your external software/hardware & localise for your keyboard layout.

___How to Use:__ Loading the script into Target Script Editor, you can access the User Preference section in the AD_EDUserPrefs_v4.x.x.tmh file. Once open you will see a screen similar to the example below. The area highlighed in Red is where you make changes:_

On the right, the text in _green_ offers further comments/instruction on how these work.

___Remember:__ After making any changes to these values to press the Save icon in the top left of the Target Script Editor window. Press the Compile button to ensure there are no errors._
