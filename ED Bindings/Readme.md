## Elite Dangerous Binding Files ##

These files map controls setup in the scripts, into Elite Dangerous. Key mappings align with TARGET Script _AD_EDKeyMap_v4.x.x.ttm_. There are also some commands mapped only in the binding files, outside of the script.

### Which One to Choose? ###

Do you own/play with one of these rudder pedals _(pictured below)_?

__YES__, choose 'WITH MFG Crosswind'. __NO__, choose 'WITHOUT MFG Crosswind'.
