## Elite Dangerous Binding Files ##

These files map controls setup in the scripts, into Elite Dangerous. Key mappings align with TARGET Script _AD_EDKeyMap_v4.x.x.ttm_. There are also some commands mapped only in the binding files, outside of the script.

Which One to Choose?

With or Without MFG Crosswind
