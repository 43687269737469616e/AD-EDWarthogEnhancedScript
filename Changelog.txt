List of Changes:

IMPROVEMENT: CruiseOnThrottle now works in both directions! When holding a Modifier and hitting 0% throttle you can engage or disengage Supercruise, just like you could previously at 100%.
IMPROVEMENT: ED-BAT updated to v0.4, now has an alternative startup link for Steam based EDLauncher, to allow use of Steam Overlay & Screenshot Capture. (This needs to be manually edited per instructions in BAT if you use Steam) (Thx SpinCykle)

FIXED: Reset HMD Orientation now mapped correctly in binding file to CTRL+HOME. (Thx T4k3shi47)
FIXED: VoiceAttack Update: Added explicit mapping for SRV Throttle Reverse (CTRL+R), same as Ship. (Thx SpinCykle)
FIXED: VoiceAttack Update: Added keybind mapping for Primary/Secondary Fire (SHIFT+1/SHIFT+2). (Note, this removes the Mouse 1/2 bindings) (Thx SpinCykle)
FIXED: VoiceAttack Update: Added keybind mapping for Exit FSS (SHIFT+F). (Note, this removes the Exit FSS mapped (Joy28+Joy4) on the Enter FSS button) (Thx SpinCykle)
