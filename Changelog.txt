Update 4.0.0:  THE LONG HYPERSPACE JUMP TO 2020


-> Big code clean-up. Along with file name changes and restructure, there has also been a Shift Key on Pinky Toggle Switch introduced to handle both new Comms Channels & Repeater Fire Mode (which can now be changed on-the-fly) changes. Script is now also available on GitHub too.


New to the script? Be sure to also check out the Beginners Reference Map in the download pack to get started.


List of Changes:

NEW: Pulse Repeater Fire Preset for Miners!
NEW: Customisable Auto-Text Chat Responses (You can now edit these via the User Preferences). (Thx CMDR Clicker & ySfte)
NEW: Enable/Disable Ship/SRV HUD when Toggling Night Vision (enable via the User Preferences).
NEW: Throttle Axis Preset (NonLinear) can now be enabled via the User Preferences. This new preset will modify the absolute 1-1 axis used in other modes and make it curve so the outside regions are slightly compressed, while slightly more movement in the center. (Thx CMDR Clicker)
NEW: Shift Key Added to Pinky Throttle Switch. This now enables multiple layouts (layers) currently configured for Comms Panel & Repeater Fire Modes. Each position enable a different mapping on Trim Hat Switch & what Repeater Fire Mode is active on Joystick Trigger.
NEW: Shift Key: Trim Hat Switch on Joystick - Change Comms Panel Mode. (FWD: Auto-Text Responses, CTR: Wing & BCK: Fighter). See Reference Maps for new layout. (This gives the Trim Hat Switch a total of 8 commands mapped per Toggle Position - both with and without Pinky modifier)
NEW: Shift Key: Trigger(s) on Joystick - Change Repeater Fire Mode on Primary/Sec.  (FRD: Combat-Continuous, CTR: Explorer-Scanner & BCK: new Mining-Pulse) (Note: Pinky Modifier still required to activate). See Reference Map for new layout.

IMPROVEMENT: Formalised & Cleaned up Script File Structure (each section now has its own separate file & is sorted).
IMPROVEMENT: Categorised User Preferences section (make it easier to find the right setting).
IMPROVEMENT: Added Secondary Fire Override, LED Blink & Combined Microphone User Preferences to Script Run Print Out on load.
IMPROVEMENT: Added Table of Contents in AD_EDFunctions file (to help find correct function quicker).
IMPROVEMENT: Added Toggle Option (mNAVBeaconToggle) to merge Wing Nav Beacon Enable & Disable into a single button instead of two. (not currently mapped/used)

MOVED: Free Camera Zoom Increase/Decrease to Coolie Hat Switch on Throttle Down/Up (due to changes on the Trim Hat Switch).
MOVED: HoloMe Undo/Redo to Coolie Hat Switch on Throttle Right/Left (due to changes on the Trim Hat Switch).

FIXED: LEDs on Launch Sequence not working (typo). (Thx CMDR Clicker)

REMOVED: Redundant ChatPresetMode in User Preference (due to changes on the Chat Toggle).
REMOVED: Redundant RepeaterFireMode moved from User Preference (this is now manually changed via Pinky Throttle Shift Switch in-game).


Fly Safe CMDRs!
