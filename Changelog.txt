Update 4.3.0: ISOLATION OBSERVANCE (Update #25)

-> Some small improvements based on user feedback and alignment to changes in Fleet Carriers update.


New to the script? Be sure to also check out the Beginners Reference Map in the download pack to get started.


List of Changes:

NEW: Set Custom Deadzone on Slew Axes on the Throttle Arm for better FA Off lateral thruster control. Change via the new SLEW_DEADZONE user preference. (Thx Berndserk for the suggestion!)
NEW: In-game Store Page axis/buttons are now mappped to Joystick Axes (Move Camera) & Throttle Slew on Arm (Zoom). KeyMap also updated with Store Page for script integration.

IMPROVEMENT: Separate Throttle Axis mappings are now possible. Map the Left Throttle axis to something else (eg. FSS Tuning?) while keeping Right mapped for Ship/SRV. Also, the Left Axis will no longer be impacted by Throttle Preset changes allowing Full Range + Foward Only combos! Use the new SyncLEFTTHRAxis user preference to set behaviour. (Thx dmakaitis for the code!)
IMPROVEMENT: Throttle Axis Mapping code has been upgraded to more efficient layout. (Thx dmakaitis for the code!)

FIXED: Joystick 'JS_DEADZONE' variable not taking effect. (Thx Berndserk for the report!)
FIXED: Fast Mode Switching Macro is now aligned for the latest UI changes in main menus.



Fly Safe CMDRs!
