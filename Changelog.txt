Update 4.0.0:  ???


-> Big code clean-up. Script is now also available on GitHub.


New to the script? Be sure to also check out the Beginners Reference Map in the download pack to get started.


List of Changes:

??? NEW: Pulse Repeater Fire Preset for Miners!! ???
NEW: Customisable Auto-Text Chat Responses (You can now edit these via the User Preferences). (Thx CMDR Clicker & ySfte)
NEW: Enable/Disable Ship/SRV HUD when Toggling Night Vision (enable via the User Preferences).

IMPROVEMENT: Reconfigured Chat Preset Toggle on the Throttle to switch between Auto-Text Responses (FWD), Wing Commands (CTR) & Fighter Commands (BCK) based on Toggle position. See Reference Map for new layout. (This gives the Trim Hat Switch a total of 8 commands mapped per Toggle Position - both with and without modifier)
IMPROVEMENT: Formalised & Cleaned up Script File Structure (each section now has its own separate file & is sorted).
IMPROVEMENT: Categorised User Preferences section (make it easier to find the right setting).
IMPROVEMENT: Added Secondary Fire Override, LED Blink & Combined Microphone User Preferences to Script Run Print Out on load.
IMPROVEMENT: Added Table of Contents in AD_EDFunctions file (to help find correct function quickly).

MOVED: Free Camera Zoom Increase/Decrease to Coolie Hat Switch on Throttle Right/Left (due to changes on the Trim Hat Switch).
MOVED: HoloMe Undo/Redo to Coolie Hat Switch on Throttle Down/Up (due to changes on the Trim Hat Switch).

FIXED: LEDs on Launch Sequence not working (typo). (Thx CMDR Clicker)

REMOVED: Redundant ChatPresetMode User Preference (due to changes on the Chat Toggle).


Fly Safe CMDRs!
